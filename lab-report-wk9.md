I am not sure what is wrong with my code there seems with my testMerge junit test. This is the output that I have been given when I ran the program. I am not sure why the cde is not working

TA:
From looking at what the junit test being printed I suggest you go to your ListExamples.java file on line 42. In order to figure out what is going on when you merge the two list. I suggest using print statements there to see what is being printed and what is going on in the code that went wrong.
