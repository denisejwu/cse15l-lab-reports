I am not sure why my bash code is not running everything looks right I am not sure what is wrong with this code in my bash script

TA:
What your code is missing is to uncomment the second line in order for the junit test to run as well as adding at the end of the code the class name of the file where you are writing your test cases

So I did what you said and now it works but I am not understanding whats wrong with my code right now I even put print statments and all I know is that it only prints one part of the array it is no adding the rest of the array.

TA: So what wrong with your code is that your incrementing the wrong index because it appears that in the code you are using index

Part2:
From the labs I didn't know how to use vim or even to use the bash script in general and it made things a lot easier to run code and to direct code where you need it. I found vim really cool to learn even though my partner in lab didn't like it too much. I also learned how to use github a lot more because before I barely knew how to use it and now it got better.
