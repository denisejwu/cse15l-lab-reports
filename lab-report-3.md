Buggy code before

for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i+=1){
  arr[i] = arr[arr.length-i-1];
  }
~~~

after code fixed



part 2
consider the commands less, find and grep and choose one. go online and find 4 interestin command-line options or alternate ways to use the command I chose. To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a built-in command on many systems called man (short for “manual”) that displays information about commands; you can use man grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works. Also consider asking ChatGPT!
