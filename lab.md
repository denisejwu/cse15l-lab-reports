 write one or two commonds of all the nine commands that you did and why the output was how it was. or like why it rand the way it ran

 Explaination:

 cd command with no argument doesn't work because it needs a file name to change into a directory otherwise it will stay at home. Thats why once it has a file commad it is able to change the directory as indicated by the green beside the user in the direcotry. As for the path since lecture1 and messages is a directory is its able change the home directory into lecture1 and then find messages to get the file the user would want.

 ls command with no agrument allows the user to see what files are in a specific directory. Like once it is in the lecture1 directory they can see that it has Hello.java, messages, Hello.class to name a few.
